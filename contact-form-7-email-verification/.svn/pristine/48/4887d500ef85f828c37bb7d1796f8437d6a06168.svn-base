Extends Contact Form 7 to allow for email addresses to be verified.

== Description ==

* This plugin is currently not being maintained. *
-- Please create pull requests via the Github link below. It's mostly a case of keeping up with the changes that happen in Contact Form 7 itself. Thanks.

This "Contact Form 7 email verification" plugin extends the "Contact Form 7" plugin to automatically verify email addresses for all form submissions.

After this plugin is activated, on a form submission..

1. The form submission does not get sent but instead saved temporarily (including attachments).
2. The sender gets sent an email with a link to click on to confirm their email address.
3. Once the link is clicked, the user gets sent back to the website with the form on, and
4. the previously submitted form gets sent as per usual for CF7 functionality.

For those interested, you can check out the code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/magician11/wpcf7-email-verification "WP CF7 email verification code on GitHub").

==TODOs==

There are things to still be done..

1. Allow verification to be set per form
2. Custom from email and name fields per form

== Installation ==

Just install and activate as per usual.

There are no settings in the current stable version to change.
