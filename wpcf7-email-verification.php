/**
 * Plugin Name: Contact Form 7 email verification
 * Plugin URI: http://golightlyplus.com/code/contact-form-7-email-verification/
 * Description: Extends Contact Form 7 (CF7) to allow for email addresses to be verified. On a form submission the form's content will not be sent, but instead will be saved for later. The sender will get emailed a link to click on to verify their email address. Once that link is clicked the form gets sent as per usual for CF7.
 * Version: 0.22
